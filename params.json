{"name":"SLADE","tagline":"It's a Doom editor","body":"### About\r\n\r\nSLADE3 is a modern editor for Doom-engine based games and source ports. It has the ability to view, modify, and write many different game-specific formats, and even convert between some of them, or from/to other generic formats such as [PNG](http://doomwiki.org/wiki/PNG).\r\n\r\nSLADE3 can be considered a successor to both [SLumpEd](http://doomwiki.org/wiki/SLumpEd) and [SLADE](http://doomwiki.org/wiki/SLADE) - it combines the [features](https://github.com/sirjuddington/SLADE/wiki/Features) of both, to create an all-in-one editor. Why does it keep the name of what was previously just a map editor? Because it fits :)\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\nHere is a brief list of features implemented in the current version of SLADE:\r\n\r\n**Basic archive/resource editing**  \r\nAll the basic resource management features you'd expect: Create/Open/Save archives, import/export, ordering, rename, etc.\r\n\r\n**Simple tabbed interface**  \r\nOpen multiple archives at once and switch between them easily via tabs. This enables simple copy/paste from one archive to another, among many other benefits.\r\n\r\n**Many supported game formats**  \r\nIn addition to full Doom [WAD](http://doomwiki.org/wiki/WAD) and [ZIP/PK3](http://doomwiki.org/wiki/PK3) support, many other game formats are supported, including:\r\n* Quake PAK/WAD2 and HUD image format\r\n* Build GRP and ART format images\r\n* Shadowcaster DAT/LIB along with most of its image formats\r\n* Amulets & Armor RES, MipImage and UI gfx\r\n* [Many more](https://github.com/sirjuddington/SLADE/wiki/Supported-Data-Formats)\r\n\r\n**Advanced text editor**  \r\nThe SLADE3 text editor can recognise many text based languages, and provide syntax hilighting, function calltips and autocomplete for them. It also has a bunch of other useful text editing features such as autoindent and find / replace.\r\n\r\n**Graphic conversion**  \r\nAll supported graphic formats can be converted to PNG/DoomGfx/DoomFlat and more, with an advanced graphic conversion dialog that provides conversion options and previews.\r\n\r\n**Texture editing**  \r\nEdit Doom composite textures (TEXTUREx) with the easy-to-use SLADE3 texture editor. Also fully supports ZDoom's enhanced composite texture format (TEXTURES).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
